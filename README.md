# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

I've tried to follow tutorials and talked with a TA. I can't make the interactive buttons appear in my javascript code. I've looked at my Javascript code and debugged errors. 
Still nothing is showing up. I've double checked my paths to make sure I'm linking the JS file correctly. I've looked at other models and still nothing is changing. I'm beyond lost.
