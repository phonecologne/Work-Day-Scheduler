#Work Day Schedulder

I've tried to follow tutorials and talked with a TA. I can't make the interactive buttons appear in my javascript code. I've looked at my Javascript code and debugged errors. Still nothing is showing up.
Right now I'm using GitHub branch pull and compare to see where the difference is and what I should do to correct the problem. I thought I followed the this tutorial by the letter.
